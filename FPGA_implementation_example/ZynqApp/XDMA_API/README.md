# XDMA API

A simple, header-only C++ API for the Xilinx XDMA IP-Core.<br>
NOTE: Currently only linux is supported.


## Requirements

	CMake >= 3.10.0
	g++ >= 9 or comparable compiler supporting C++17

### XDMA Driver

Either use the latest version from the [official git](https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers) or the version (v2020.2.0) included here.

#### Using the official git:

**Checkout and build**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers
cd dma_ip_drivers/XDMA/linux-kernel/xdma
make
sudo make install
```

**Test load the driver**

```bash
cd ../tests
sudo ./load_driver.sh
```

#### Using the included driver:

**Build**

```bash
cd driver/xdma
make
sudo make install
```

**Test load the driver**

```bash
cd ..
sudo ./load_driver.sh
```

#### Additional settings for both:

**Allow users to access the XDMA devices**

```bash
echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"xdma\", GROUP=\"users\", MODE=\"0666\"" | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60-xdma.rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

**Check the permissions**

The following command should output several xdma0_xxxx devices, e.g., xdma0_c2h_0 and xdma0_h2c_0, the number of devices and which are available depends on the configuration of the XDMA endpoint. If no devices are displayed make sure the FPGA is plugged in and has been programmed.

```bash
ls -la /dev/xdma*
```

**Automatically load the driver on boot**

```bash
echo "xdma" | sudo tee /etc/modules
echo "options xdma poll_mode=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/xdma_options.conf 
```

## Usage

For a fully working example please refer to the examples provided in the samples folder.

### Include the API into a project

Clone the git into your project or add it as a submodule

	git clone https://github.com/fporrmann/XDMA_API.git

When using CMake simply add the XDMA API as follows:

```cmake
# Find the XDMA_API and initialize its variables
find_package(XDMA_API PATHS XDMA_API/API/cmake/modules REQUIRED)

# Add the XDMA API to the include directories
include_directories(${XDMA_API_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Link against the libraries required by the XDMA API
target_link_libraries (<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> PRIVATE ${XDMA_API_LIBS})
```

When not using CMake, add XDMA_API/API/include to the include search path of your environment and link against pthread (or which ever threading library is used by your compiler in combination with std::thread).

### Use the API

At the moment please refer to the [DDRAccess example](samples/DDRAccess/src/main.cpp).

# yeo-johnson-transformation
##ABOUT
This project is about implementing an existing functionality from the python sklearn library in C Code.
The sklearn library provides the sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer class to find a lambda which is used for the Yeo Johnson transformation.
For more information to sklearn, see the [sklearn-powerTransformer] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer.html)
For more information to the Yeo-Johnson-Transformation, see the [yjpower.pdf] (https://www.stat.umn.edu/arc/yjpower.pdf)

##OBJECTIVE
The aim is to implement said functionality in C to get a better performance and enable its use for bigger data.

##REFERENCE
This project is initiated by "Dipl. Inf. S. May" from "Ostfalia Hochschule Wolfenb√ºttel".
